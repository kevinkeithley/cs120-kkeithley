    <title>Security Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is a security assessment of the website jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com, a web app built with Node.js and Express.
    The goal is to identify issues related to security as well as the severity of the risk and potential fixes.</p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>The assessment was conducted using several tools (nmap, burpsuite, and nikto). There was also code analysis and manual testing using curl.
    </p>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>The security assessment showed several areas of vulnerabilites. There is a lack of input validation and sanitization allowing for potential
    sql injection attacks. There are also poor access controls, allowing anybody to access resources at API endpoints.</p>
    <h2>Black-box attempts</h2>
        <p>NMAP scan shows two open ports, 80/tcp http and 443/tcp https. This passes the smell test so far with no goofy ports available.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, burpsuite was used to look at the request and response headers and content. Nothing immediately looked suspicious, other than
        naming a server Cowboy XD.</p>
        <img src="img\burpSuiteResponseHeaders.PNG">
        <p>I also ran a nikto scan for each of the open ports.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="basicnikto.html">Nikto scan of port 80</a></li>
            <li><a href="sslnikto.html">Nikto scan of port 443</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Again nothing particularly nefarious stuck out, with most of the items noting potentially abnormal header options.</p>
    <h2>Code review</h2>
    <p>The next step involved manual review of the code as well as manual testing using curl. The following vulnerabilites were noted.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>For the client connection, ssl has rejectUnauthorized set to false. This is ok for development purposes, but in a production environment,
        it would be best to set it to true to ensure that the connection is secure. <br><strong>Security risk: medium</strong> <br>As this is a public facing
        app, the risk is much more signficant than in a secured environment.<br>This can be fixed by switching the flag to true.</li>
        <li>The CORS policy is set to '*', which is risky as it allows any website access to the resources at that route.<br><strong>Security risk: medium</strong>
        <br>As this app would likely be receiving requests from a not-uber app, it would be worth only accepting requests from say the not-uber.com address.</li>
        <li>Unsanitized input allowing for sql injection and cross site scripting. /rides and /update both allow unsanitized inputs for username. This was used to
        perform an attack quite easily.<img src="img/XSS.PNG"><strong>Security risk: high</strong><br>The validator library is already used to enforce
        float values for lat and lng. There is no reason to not extend this functionality to all inputs.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This app contains several security vulnerabilities, with some that require immediate attention. The ability for sql injection attacks
    is particularly high, and needs immediate priority attention. Proper input validation and sanitization would be a large step forward for this app.</p>
