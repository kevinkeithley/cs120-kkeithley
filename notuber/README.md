# The Ride-Hailing Service, Part 1
I believe all aspects of the work have been implemented correctly.

I bounced some ideas around with Christian Widmark.

I spent approximately an hour and a half on this lab.

Initial performance metrics:
74 requests
13.6 kb transferred
1.5 MB resources
finished in 652 ms

Performance steps:
I was already loading CSS first in the head section, not sure where else I would load it.
Minify CSS - deleted some white space
Javascript was already loaded before the closing body tag.
Entire javascript code is 33 lines, doubtful that minifying would lead to any 
meaningful performance differences.

New metrics:
75 requests
304 kb transferred
1.5 MB resources
772ms

# The Ride-Hailing Service, Part 2
I believe all aspects of the work have been implemented correctly. I could probably clean up how I did the infoWindow.

Shared thoughts with Christian Widmark and Valerie (not sure what her last name is).

Def took a few hours on this one. Maybe 3, 4?

# The Ride-Hailing Service, Part 3
I believe all aspects of the work have been implemented correctly. I did the bare minimum on this lab XD.

Shared thoughts with final project group.

Probably took several hours to complete.
